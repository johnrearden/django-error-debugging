# django-debugging
Django project with multiple branches, each with a single bug

# Instructions

Click the gitpod button and open your own workspace from this git repository. You can checkout each
branch in turn (there are 7 in all) e.g. 

`git checkout branch1`

Then run the server with 

`python manage.py runserver`

And try to fix the bug! There's a link to a video of each fix below, but give it a go on your own first! You won't be able to push to the remote repo on Github (unless you fork your own version of the project), but you can pin your workspace, save your work and run `git add .` and `git commit -m '{MEANINGFUL_MESSAGE}'` in the local git repo.

If you'd just like to switch back to the main branch without committing any changes you've made, you can run `git reset --hard`, which will return the filesystem to the state it was in just after the last commit.
